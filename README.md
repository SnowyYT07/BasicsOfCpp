## C++ Basic Course (Source Codes)‚ö°Ô∏è
Based on the video of [BroCode](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez).

Using his video [C++ Full Course for free ‚ö°Ô∏è](https://youtube.com/watch?v=-TkoO8Z07hI) I made this project, its simply a collection of source codes in his video.
For each topic he covered i made a code like him, and uploaded here for people that are learning C++ too.
Basically i compressed his 6 hour video in a repository for easy learn.
